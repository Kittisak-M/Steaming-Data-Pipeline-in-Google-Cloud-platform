## 📌 Business Purpose

Fastyle is a rapidly expanding fast-fashion company with **20 branches nationwide**. As the business grows, efficiently managing inventory and analyzing sales data is critical for sustainable growth and profitability. Fastyle also plans to expand into online sales, making centralized and accessible data even more essential.

Currently, data is scattered across systems, making it hard for the data team to extract insights. This project aims to build a **scalable, real-time data engineering pipeline** to support business growth and improve data accessibility.

### ✅ Project Scope Includes:
- ETL/ELT pipeline development  
- Cost estimation and cloud optimization  
- Real-time streaming architecture  
- Creation of a data mart for reporting
- Deploy API

## 🗂️ Data Sources
- POS system API (using Cloud function to create steamming data)

---

## 🧰 Data Stack

- **Pub/Sub** – Real-time data ingestion (e.g., sales transactions, inventory changes)  
- **Cloud Storage** – Raw data lake storage  
- **Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow)** – Orchestration of ETL pipelines
- **Cloud SQL**
- **BigQuery** – Scalable data warehouse for analytics and reporting
